				I´m a senior User-Experience designer, and I currently develop User-Interface and Interaction concepts for teleoperated Autonomous Vehicles at BMW Group. Since 2009 I have worked on numerous projects for screens and paper, and I have also been honored by the German design award council in 2016.  
<br><br>
				I am currently available for consultancy, small-scale projects, as well as for design and art direction. I have a lot to say to you, but first, <a href="mailto:info@graf.business">tell me</a> about your project!
